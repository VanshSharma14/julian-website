            Hello! I'm Julian Grande, aspiring software engineer currently
            pursuing my degree at Rutgers University, set to graduate in 2024.
            Proficient in languages such as Java and C/C++, I specialize in
            crafting innovative Android apps and libraries. My journey in
            computer science is fueled by a{" "}
            <span className="font-bold">profound passion for technology</span>,
            and I am genuinely motivated by the dynamic and ever-evolving nature
            of the field. My goal is to contribute to the creation of software
            that not only meets the needs of users but{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-[#078080]">
              leaves a lasting impact
            </span>
            .
          </p>

          <p className="py-2 text-[#222525] text-left font-[Arial]">
            Besides Software, I am also deeply passionate about cars and their
            performance, particularly f1 racing. In my spare time, I like to do
            weightlifting and I love to listen to rnb and pop music.
